# Arduino Embedded Projects
# Embedded Systems with Arduino – Project Collection

This repository contains projects I completed as part of my **Embedded Systems with Arduino** course. The course covered foundational concepts like embedded architecture, memory management, Arduino interfacing using Tinkercad, and hands-on projects using various sensors and modules.

## 🔧 Course Topics Covered
- Basics of Embedded Systems
- Microcontroller Architecture & Memory Management
- Arduino UNO R3 Board & C++ Programming
- Tinkercad-based Simulations
